      Vegetables provide the body with vitamins it can use as fuel. Most vegetables contain high amounts of fiber which is fantastic for your muscles and overall health. Vegetables are also low-fat and do not hold a lot of calories which is great.

      Protein is necessary for the human body to function. Proteins are what makes up the cells in our bodies and is what helps build muscle. Many different kinds of supplements and powders exist but natural protein through foods is the best in my opinion.

      Grains provide many nutrients to the body and are a good source of fiber. People that incorporate grains into their diets are also at a lower risk for chronic diseases and other health problems as they grow older.
