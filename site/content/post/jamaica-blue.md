  Nick sets new personal records on the bench and the squat rack.

He said in the beginning of the week that he felt good and that his body was up for the challenge of pushing it to the limits.

He did not disappoint. Nick went ahead and benched a 1 rep max of 200 lbs. and then squatted for a PR of 285 lbs. for 4 reps. This was insane!

## Nick's Past

Nick started lifting at the beginning of his high school career. He not only liked lifting weights, he loved it. He noticed a difference in his strength not long after his start and he was astonished. While he played three sports in high school, strength was a big part of his game and so this change caused his abilities to skyrocket.  

>"My favorite lift is the deadlift. I believe it is the best for the body and it suits my physical build the best".

Nick hurt his back deadlifting a few years back and it took a while for him to get comfortable again but he persisted.
