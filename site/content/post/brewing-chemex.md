The kids persisted on playing basketball in the driveway this week even through the pouring rain. As long as there was not thunder or lightning, they thought it would be okay for them to continue playing.

They played a total of 8 hours on Saturday and the boys definitely got their daily amount of physical activity in! While they do not play organized sports often, it is important for them to continue playing in the neighborhood as it build their fitness levels and camaraderie.
